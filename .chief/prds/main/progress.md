## Codebase Patterns
- Project uses Vite + vanilla TypeScript (no framework)
- PIXI.js v8 for canvas rendering — use `new Application()` then `await app.init(...)` pattern
- Source code lives in `src/`
- npm is the package manager (no bun/pnpm)
- TypeScript strict mode enabled with `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters`
- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` for typecheck, `npx vite build` for build
- Canvas is full-viewport with `resizeTo: window`, background `#1a1a2e`
- Box labels live in `src/config.ts` as a `BOX_LABELS` string array (0-based index, box 1 = index 0)
- Grid rendering lives in `src/grid.ts`, exports `createGrid(app)` → returns `BoxInfo[]`
- `BoxInfo` has `index`, `container`, `cx`, `cy`, `w`, `h` — needed for line drawing in future stories
- Connection logic lives in `src/connections.ts`, exports `setupConnections(app, boxes)` → returns `ConnectionManager`
- `ConnectionManager` has `connections: Connection[]` (mutable array) and `redraw()` to re-render all lines
- `Connection` interface: `{ source: number; target: number }` (0-based box indices)
- Lines use quadratic bezier curves with perpendicular offset, arrowheads at target box edge
- `touch-action: none` on canvas element prevents browser gestures from interfering with drag
- Tap vs drag detection: compare pointer movement distance against `TAP_THRESHOLD` (10px) in `endDrag`
- `selectedBoxIndex` state in `setupConnections` tracks tap-tap selection; `highlightLayer` renders the visual highlight
- Supabase client lives in `src/supabase.ts` — exports `supabase` singleton
- Submit logic lives in `src/submit.ts` — exports `isSubmitted()` and `submitConnections(connections)`
- Box indices are 0-based internally but stored as 1-based in Supabase (source_box + 1, target_box + 1)
- Session ID generated via `crypto.randomUUID()` and stored in `localStorage` key `linjer_session_id`
- Submission state tracked via `localStorage` key `linjer_submitted` ("true" when submitted)
- Connections saved to `localStorage` key `linjer_connections` as JSON after submission
- `getStoredConnections()` in `submit.ts` retrieves saved connections from localStorage (returns `Connection[]` 0-based)
- Results button (`#results-btn`) shares position with submit button — they're mutually exclusive in visibility
- Supabase RPC functions: `supabase.rpc('fn_name')` returns `{ data, error }` — use `SECURITY DEFINER` for anonymous access
- `drawConnection(g, source, target, color, width)` is exported from connections.ts — reusable for any line rendering
- Results rendering lives in `src/results.ts` — `createResultsRenderer(app, boxes)` returns `{ showResults, hide, visible }`
- All colors centralized in `THEME` object in `src/config.ts` — change palette by editing one file
- CSS uses custom properties (`:root` vars) aligned with JS theme — e.g. `var(--bg)`, `var(--accent)`
- When using `as const` on theme objects, add explicit `: number` type annotations to function params that accept theme color values to avoid literal type mismatch

## 2026-03-02 - US-001
- Set up Vite + TypeScript project scaffold
- Installed PIXI.js v8 and created full-viewport responsive canvas
- Canvas uses `resizeTo: window`, `autoDensity: true`, and `devicePixelRatio` for crisp mobile rendering
- Added `index.html` with viewport meta (no scaling), CSS reset for full-screen canvas
- Files changed: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `index.html`, `src/main.ts`, `.gitignore`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Vite `create` won't scaffold into a non-empty directory — set up manually instead
  - PIXI.js v8 uses async init pattern: `const app = new Application(); await app.init({...})`
  - `autoDensity: true` + `resolution: devicePixelRatio` ensures sharp rendering on high-DPI phone screens
  - The viewport meta tag needs `maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no` to prevent pinch-zoom on mobile
---

## 2026-03-02 - US-002
- Rendered 11 boxes in a 3-3-3-2 grid layout (Tier 4 at top, Tier 1 at bottom)
- Created `src/config.ts` with `BOX_LABELS` array — easy to swap labels
- Created `src/grid.ts` with `createGrid()` that positions boxes responsively
- Boxes have rounded corners, borders, centered text labels, and adapt to screen size
- Updated `src/main.ts` to import and call `createGrid(app)`
- Files changed: `src/config.ts` (new), `src/grid.ts` (new), `src/main.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - PIXI.js v8 `Graphics` API: use `bg.roundRect(...)` then `bg.fill(...)` then `bg.stroke(...)` — chained shape → fill → stroke
  - Box numbering is 0-based internally (array index) but 1-based in user-facing context — `BOX_LABELS[0]` = box 1
  - The grid ROWS constant maps visual rows (top-to-bottom) to box indices — bottom row has 2 boxes, rest have 3
  - `BoxInfo` interface is exported for future stories (line drawing will need `cx`, `cy` for connection endpoints)
  - Text `wordWrapWidth` should be box width minus padding to keep text readable
---

## 2026-03-02 - US-003
- Implemented drag-to-connect interaction between boxes
- Created `src/connections.ts` with full pointer event handling (pointerdown on boxes, pointermove/pointerup on stage)
- Preview line (green, semi-transparent) follows finger during drag, disappears if drag ends outside a box
- Committed connections rendered as bezier curves (quadratic, with perpendicular offset) with arrowheads
- Lines start/end at box edges using ray-box intersection calculation
- Added `touch-action: none` to canvas CSS in `index.html` for reliable mobile touch handling
- Files changed: `src/connections.ts` (new), `src/main.ts`, `index.html`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - PIXI v8 pointer events: set `eventMode = 'static'` and `hitArea` on containers for interaction
  - Use `app.stage.hitArea = app.screen` to capture stage-level pointer events
  - `pointercancel` event should be handled on mobile (browser can steal touch for gestures)
  - For bezier arrowheads: tangent at t=1 of quadratic bezier P0,CP,P2 is direction `P2 - CP`
  - Box edge intersection: compare `|dx|/halfW` vs `|dy|/halfH` to determine which edge is hit
  - `FederatedPointerEvent.global` gives coordinates in stage space (matches CSS coords with autoDensity)
---

## 2026-03-02 - US-004
- Added tap-tap fallback for creating connections (tap one box, then tap another)
- Distinguishes taps from drags by measuring pointer movement distance (< 10px = tap)
- Selected box gets a green highlight overlay (rounded rect with fill alpha 0.15 and stroke alpha 0.8)
- Tapping the same box twice deselects it; tapping empty space also deselects
- Both drag and tap-tap work simultaneously — drag takes precedence when movement exceeds threshold
- Added `highlightLayer` Graphics between boxes and linesLayer for proper z-ordering
- Files changed: `src/connections.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tap vs drag: track `dragStartX`/`dragStartY` on pointerdown, compare distance on pointerup
  - `highlightLayer` is inserted before `linesLayer` in stage children order so highlights appear behind lines
  - The green highlight uses the same color as the preview line (`SELECTED_COLOR = 0x53c28b`) for visual consistency
  - `BOX_RADIUS` (10) from grid.ts must be matched by `HIGHLIGHT_RADIUS` in connections.ts for the highlight overlay to align with box corners
- `getBezierParams(source, target)` returns `{ start, end, cpX, cpY }` — reuse for any bezier curve operation (drawing, hit testing, animation)
- For fade-out animations: create temp `Graphics` layer, decrement `layer.alpha` via `app.ticker`, `destroy()` when alpha ≤ 0
- HTML overlay elements (fixed-position buttons/toasts) work well for UI controls on top of the PIXI canvas
- `ConnectionManager` returned from `setupConnections()` has `connections`, `redraw()`, and `resetAll()`
---

## 2026-03-02 - US-005
- Implemented connection removal via three methods: toggle (same connection again), tap on line, and both drag/tap-tap paths
- Extracted `getBezierParams` helper from `drawConnection` for reuse in hit testing and removal animation
- Added `hitTestLine` that samples 20 points along each bezier curve and checks distance to tap point (threshold: 20px)
- Added `animateRemoval` that draws the removed line on a temporary Graphics layer and fades it out over ~300ms using `app.ticker`
- Added `toggle` closure inside `setupConnections` that checks for existing connection before adding/removing
- Refactored `drawConnection` to accept an optional `color` parameter for future use (e.g., heatmap/aggregate styling)
- Files changed: `src/connections.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `getBezierParams` returns the start/end edge points and control point — reuse for any bezier-related feature (hit testing, styling, labels)
  - PIXI v8 `Ticker.add(fn)` / `Ticker.remove(fn)` works with plain function references; no special signature required
  - For fade animations: create a temporary `Graphics`, set `layer.alpha`, decrement in ticker, then `destroy()` when done
  - Line hit testing via bezier sampling: 20 samples (t += 0.05) with a 20px threshold works well for touch targets on mobile
  - Squared distance comparison `(dx**2 + dy**2 < threshold**2)` avoids unnecessary `Math.sqrt` calls in hot loops
---

## 2026-03-02 - US-006
- Added "Nulstil" (Reset) button fixed at bottom-center of screen, only visible when connections exist
- Added 3-second "Fortryd" (Undo) toast that appears after reset — tapping it restores all removed connections
- Extended `ConnectionManager` with `resetAll()` method that clears connections array, deselects, and redraws
- Button and toast are HTML elements overlaid on the canvas (not PIXI objects) for better touch handling and styling
- Files changed: `src/connections.ts`, `src/main.ts`, `index.html`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - HTML overlay buttons work well for UI controls on top of PIXI canvas — easier to style and more accessible than PIXI-based UI
  - `resetAll()` returns the removed connections array so callers can implement undo
  - Using `requestAnimationFrame` to poll `connections.length` for button visibility is simple and avoids needing custom events
  - Fixed-position buttons with `bottom: 24px` + `left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%)` center well on mobile
  - The `#undo-toast` sits at `bottom: 80px` to stay above the reset button without overlap
---

## 2026-03-02 - US-007 + US-009
- Created Supabase `connections` table with columns: id (uuid PK), session_id (text), source_box (smallint), target_box (smallint), created_at (timestamptz)
- RLS enabled with policies for anonymous inserts and selects
- Installed `@supabase/supabase-js` SDK
- Created `src/supabase.ts` with Supabase client singleton (project URL + anon key)
- Created `src/submit.ts` with session ID generation, submission logic, and localStorage state management
- Added "Send" submit button (green, fixed bottom-right) — visible when connections exist, hidden after submission
- Added error toast ("Noget gik galt — prøv igen") for failed submissions with 4-second auto-dismiss
- Button shows "Sender..." while submitting and is disabled during request
- After successful submission: button hidden, reset button hidden, connections + session_id saved to localStorage
- Updated `main.ts` to wire up submit button, manage submitted state, and hide reset/submit after submission
- Files changed: `src/supabase.ts` (new), `src/submit.ts` (new), `src/main.ts`, `index.html`, `package.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Supabase anon key is safe to embed client-side — RLS policies control access, not the key
  - `submitConnections()` converts 0-based box indices to 1-based before inserting (source + 1, target + 1)
  - The submit button sits at `right: 24px` to avoid overlapping the centered reset button
  - Error toast at `bottom: 80px; right: 24px` to position above the submit button
  - `isSubmitted()` checks localStorage on page load — used by main.ts to skip showing submit/reset buttons
---

## 2026-03-02 - US-008
- Added `getStoredConnections()` to `submit.ts` — retrieves saved connections from localStorage with JSON parse error handling
- On page load, if `isSubmitted()` is true, connections are restored from localStorage, pushed into `manager.connections`, and `redraw()` renders them on canvas
- Added "Se resultater" button (`#results-btn`) in HTML — shown after submission (both fresh and restored from localStorage)
- After fresh submission, the results button is now displayed alongside hiding submit/reset buttons
- Files changed: `src/submit.ts`, `src/main.ts`, `index.html`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `getStoredConnections()` parses `linjer_connections` from localStorage — returns `Connection[]` (0-based indices, same as internal format)
  - The `#results-btn` is positioned at `bottom: 24px; right: 24px` — same position as submit button (they're never both visible)
  - Restoring state on load: push stored connections into `manager.connections` then call `manager.redraw()` — the connections array is shared by reference
  - The results button is a placeholder for US-010 (aggregate results) — its click handler will be wired up in that story
---

## 2026-03-02 - US-010
- Created Supabase RPC function `get_aggregate_connections()` that returns grouped connection counts (source_box, target_box, count) ordered by count DESC
- Exported `drawConnection` from `connections.ts` with configurable width parameter for reuse in aggregate rendering
- Created `src/results.ts` with `createResultsRenderer(app, boxes)` — manages two PIXI Graphics layers (aggregate + user highlights)
- Aggregate lines rendered with variable thickness proportional to count (MIN_WIDTH=1.5 to MAX_WIDTH=10), color `0x8899bb` at 0.7 alpha
- User's own connections highlighted on top in distinct red (`0xe94560`) at width 3 so they stand out
- Results button changes to "Opdater resultater" after first fetch, allowing refresh to see new submissions
- Loading state ("Henter...") and error handling with toast for failed fetches
- Files changed: `src/connections.ts`, `src/main.ts`, `src/results.ts` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Supabase RPC functions created via `CREATE FUNCTION ... RETURNS TABLE` + `SECURITY DEFINER` work with anonymous access
  - Call RPC via `supabase.rpc('function_name')` — returns `{ data, error }` like regular queries
  - `drawConnection` now accepts `width` parameter — callers can control line thickness for aggregate vs user lines
  - PIXI `addChildAt(child, index)` inserts at specific z-order — use `boxes.length` as insert index to place layers above boxes but below interaction layers
  - Aggregate layer at `alpha=0.7` provides good visual separation from user's own highlighted connections
---

## 2026-03-02 - US-011
- Centralized all colors into a `THEME` object in `src/config.ts` — single place to change the entire color palette
- Added CSS custom properties (`:root` vars) in `index.html` aligned with the JS theme constants
- Added shared `.btn` CSS class with transition effects for all buttons (smoother hover/active states)
- Added subtle glow effect behind each box (semi-transparent rounded rect slightly larger than the box)
- Replaced all hardcoded color values in `grid.ts`, `connections.ts`, `results.ts`, and `main.ts` with `THEME.*` references
- Changed HTML `body` background from `#0a0a0a` to `var(--bg)` so it matches the canvas seamlessly
- Files changed: `src/config.ts`, `src/grid.ts`, `src/connections.ts`, `src/results.ts`, `src/main.ts`, `index.html`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `as const` on a theme object makes all values literal types — functions accepting theme colors need explicit `: number` type annotations to avoid `Argument of type 'X' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Y'` errors
  - CSS custom properties (`:root` vars) can't import from JS, but keeping values aligned manually is a good compromise for a short-lived project
  - A `GLOW_SPREAD` of 6px with 0.18 alpha provides a subtle, non-distracting glow behind boxes
  - Adding `transition: background 0.15s ease` to buttons gives a more polished feel on touch interactions
  - The `.btn` shared class pattern reduces CSS duplication across multiple button styles
